# IITK-CSE-Course-Materials

**Hello!!!**

My name is **Mandar Bapat**, a **Y19 CSE** undergraduate student at IITK. You probably stumbled across this repo maybe because its your Mid-Sem or End-Sem exam tomorrow and you cannot find previous year papers or maybe you just want to know more about the course. There were times, when I myself wanted some good resources but either the websites were taken down or they had the same repititive content. In some courses, I discovered resources that were very helpful but these were not known to many students. At other times, I wanted guidance on some specific topics of the course, but could not as most of the resource websites had very general description about the course. I found that a single reference book was not good for all the topics of the course.

I have tried to compile everything that I had collected during my journey. I will also give a brief description about the course, course instructor, the instructor's marking scheme and how I prepared for it(or how I should have prepared for itðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…). I have also provided topic specific resources also(which are very important from exam point of view).

**Note :** The experiences that I describe here are subjective and do not expect that the course will move in the same direction as I described. Yes, there are some things that are general and happen all the time, but they can change as the course depends on the instructor. I met people who had different experiences for the same course because they had different instructors. But most importantly, how you perform in the course depends very much on how you consistently study for that course and are ready to accept any kind of hardships.

This repo contains the study material for all the courses that I have completed till now and some other study material also.(_Will keep on updating till my B.Tech finishes_)
